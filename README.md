### **1. Challenges and Overall Experience**

The most challenging part of this assignment was organizing the file structure and ensuring that all relative links between pages worked correctly after moving files to separate folders. Working with **HTML** and **CSS** was straightforward at first, but achieving responsiveness and alignment across different screen sizes required extra effort. Overall, the assignment took approximately **2 hours** to complete.

### **2. Decisions for Mobile-Friendliness**

To make the site mobile-friendly, I:

- Used **media queries** to adjust layouts for smaller screens.
- Ensured the navbar becomes a dropdown menu on smaller devices.
- Allowed game boards and tables to stack vertically when the screen size is too narrow to display them side by side.

These changes make the website accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### **3. Design Considerations**

I aimed for a clean and professional design with a focus on **readability** and **user experience**:

- Used a **black-and-white theme** with subtle hover effects for interactivity.
- Added SVG icons and hover effects to enhance visual appeal.
- Maintained a simple structure to ensure the site is easy to navigate.

I’m particularly proud of the responsive navbar and the high scores page, which features zebra striping and hover effects for better readability.

### **4. Future Enhancements**

Given more time or resources, I would add the following features:

- **Dynamic content** for the game page (e.g., playable boards with hit/miss functionality).
- **Animations** for transitions between pages.
- **Custom fonts** to enhance the overall branding of the site.

### **5. Time Spent**

I spent approximately **8 hours** on this assignment.

### **7. Credits**

- **Icons/Fonts:** The icons used in the navbar and rules list are standard Unicode emojis.
- **Inspiration:** The general design was inspired by examples from coursework and simple HTML/CSS tutorials.
- **External Resources:**
- Fonts: Default system fonts (Arial, sans-serif).
- Images: Amazon product cover(https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-4730-Battleship/dp/B00000DMBB)
